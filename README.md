# NourishNow

NourishNow is a web application designed to combat the dual issues of food waste and food insecurity. This innovative platform connects food donors, such as restaurants, hotels, and caterers, with organizations that serve people in need, including homeless shelters, food banks, and low-income families. By facilitating the donation and distribution of excess food, NourishNow aims to create a more sustainable and equitable food system. Thereby, the objective of this project is to mitigate the food wastage and ensure that superfluous food is directed to the needful, ensuring a tech-driven social change for a sustainable future.

## Sustainable Development Goal

NourishNow directly addresses Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. The platform's primary objective is to ensure that surplus food is redistributed to those who need it most, thereby reducing food waste and alleviating hunger. By connecting food providers with organizations that serve food-insecure populations, NourishNow contributes to ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture.

## Concept

NourishNow utilizes the concept of a sharing economy, where underutilized resources such as excess food are shared with those in need. This approach not only helps bridge the gap between food donors and recipients but also addresses social and environmental challenges by reducing food waste.

## Features

- **Food Donation Interface**: Food donors can easily upload information about available food items, including details like type, quantity, and condition.
- **User Accessibility**: People in need can browse through available food donations, prioritize cooked items to prevent spoilage, and make informed decisions about their choices.
- **Sustainability Efforts**: NourishNow promotes sustainability by minimizing food waste through efficient distribution.
